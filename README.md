# Continental Defense

Continental Defense is a 3D Mobile Tower Defense game made with [Unity 2020.3.22](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.3.22). 
While doing it, I followed [Brackeys Tower Defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beuoNuK2tbk&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR4u5jX8za5iU1cqnQPmbzG0&index=1) tutorial on Youtube.
I tried both URP and HDRP but since this game is for mobile and not that advanced, I sticked with Built-In Pipeline.

This game was a Master's Degree project for class named Mobile Development with Unity.

My friends in the group modeled monsters.
